# Final-Boot-Camp-Project
The task of the project was to use python and to perform male and female voice recognition.
The file 0 record and graph audio files contains the python code to perfrom the first tasks in the voice recognition.
File 1 extracts audio feature from wave files.
File 2 deals with machine learning algorithms to perform voice recognition and provide the best ML model.
File 3 shows webscraping performance at wikipedia. 

The following kaggle datasets were used for this project:
